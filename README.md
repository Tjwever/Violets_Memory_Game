# Violets_Memory_Game
Simple matching game for my daughter

        (UPDATE) - I spent too long letting this just sit here...daughter is no longer interested in Princesses...oops.  Maybe I'll just redo this but with different cards and in React or Svelte for practice.

The current plan is to make it work (obvi) but then to add small implementations to it to make it more complex.  There will be an easy and a normal mode.  Easy mode will have less cards and show you where they're at when the game first starts.  Normal mode will have more cards and won't show you where the cards are at at the beginning.  May add a hard mode that will have even more cards, and maybe do something tricky like randomly move cards around, or give you a limit to how many times you're allowed to flip cards.  I don't know, I'll think about it.

The other feature that I'll have, is there will be icons at the top of the page that when you click them, it'll reset the game and change the theme of the matching game.  Right now I have Frozen, Moana, and Princesses.  Will more than likely add more as her tastes change all the time.
